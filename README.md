This repository contains  a collection of projects for demonstrating my skills

In the respective subfolders you will find projects that I have created as part of courses or the completion of courses. When putting them together, I made sure not to select any tasks that were too trivial. 

## Below is an overview of the projects:

### CS50w_project1_wiki:
* Tech-Stack: Python/Django/HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* The task of this project was to program an application similar to Wikipedia. The basic structure (index.html) and the function of util.py were predefined. I created urls.py, views.py and most of the other HTML pages as part of the project.

### CS50p_final_pycolino:
* Tech stack: Python/CSV
* This is a completely self-created final project for Harvard's CS50 Python course. The script reads directory structures and permanently clones them into a CSV file. The directory can be called via the command line and the files in it can be commented.
